# Numix Icons & Gtk Theme

## Intro

Numix Icons & Gtk Theme for Fedora, CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

## Links
* [Numix Project](http://numixproject.org)
* [Numix Fedora Copr](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/numix/numix)

## Remarks
The upstream source repositories do not have any versioning tags enabled.
That is why there is at the moment only a git based rpm version.

This git based version is considered a bad example on how to package for RPM
based systems. Please do not use this example as a reference.

Keep on hacking.

## Enabling it

### On Fedora
	$ sudo dnf copr enable -y numix/numix
	$ sudo dnf install -y numix-\*
